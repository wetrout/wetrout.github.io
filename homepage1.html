  <section title="About Me">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Will Trout and I am currently a second-year engineering student
      at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I really like to learn and try new things,
      so I have created this website as a personal project to learn html, to share things
      that I find interesting, and to document my accomplishments.

    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I love to spend time outdoors riding my bike, backpacking/hiking, swimming, and exploring.</li>
      <li>I really like to write, but I never found a great outlet to do so independently until I started working on this site!</li>
      <li>I am working on my health habits. I really like to run and I am getting better at it. I am also experimenting with a paleo diet. I drink a lot of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTS-Organic-Kombucha-Gingerade-bottle/dp/B01M9GLFZ5/ref=asc_df_B01M9GLFZ5/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312068890447&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=790502329130511471&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011279&hvtargid=pla-569757805384&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=62425923272&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312068890447&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=790502329130511471&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011279&hvtargid=pla-569757805384" target="_blank">kombucha</a>.</li>
      <li>I cook a lot. I try to cook at least a meal a day, and I mix it up so that I learn all kinds of recipes/techniques. Right now, I'm working on the omelette.</li>
      <li>I am currently learning how to play the bass. I have played piano since I was six years old.</li>

  <section title="Website Goals">
    <h1>Website Goals</h1>
    <p>Right now, this website is very basic. It would look a lot better if I used a
      website editor like Squarespace to put it together rather than write it myself
      from scratch using html, CSS, and Javascript. But nevertheless, here I am. I
      have my LinkedIn profile linked in (shameless pun) the contact information
      section below if you want to get a better picture of my resume and see my
      accomplishments. I will be working on this with spare time that I have during
      the fall semester of 2019, and I hope to have a site that I am happy with and
      that's beginning to look professional by the time Christmas rolls around this year.
      Of course, I will always continue to add to it and improve features. My goal is to
      have this homepage with links to my resume, pages for all the college projects I
      have done, pages for my personal projects, and a blog that I will regularly use
      to share my progress on these projects and which will autonomously add these updates
      to posts my LinkedIn profile. I plan to keep track of major updates by maintaining
      an "about my website" page where I will link .html files of each version of my
      site that I upload as I go along so a user can track my progress.
      <br><br>
      tldr: My website sucks, but it won't.
