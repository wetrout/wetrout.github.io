      The Assignment:
    </h3>
      <p>
        We were given an Arduino Uno and a robot arm and we were asked to program the
        robot to perform some function of our choosing.
        We had the semester to work on this project.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Our Idea:
    </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, we wanted to use Matlab to program the robot arm because the class
        focused on teaching us how to use Matlab to solve engineering problems. However,
        the Geekduino device that was attached to the robot arm when we recieved it
        would not communicate with Matlab and we would have had to use another compatible
        Arduino Uno in tandem to program the device using Matlab. We decided to use the Arduino IDE instead
        for a simpler design. Eventually, however, we removed the Geekduino and
        integrated the compatible Arduino Uno so we could use Matlab (none of us
        were familiar with the Arduino IDE when the project began).
      </p>
    <h3>
      Final Design<br>
      <a href="robot.mov" target="blank">Video</a>
    </h3>
      <p>
        Our final robot arm, programmed in Matlab, picked up a bolt, scanned it for
        imperfections using a laptop webcam, weighed it, checked its deflection under
        pressure, and either discarded the bolt if it was faulty or placed it in a
        "good quality" zone.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What I Learned
    </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I learned how to use Matlab to interact with a device and program it to
          perform tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          I developed a much deeper understanding of Matlab.
        </li>
        <li>
          I had exposure to my first real-world engineering project.
        </li>
        <li>
          My teammates were upperclassmen so I got to learn about working with more
          experienced peers and getting them to help fill in my knowledge gaps.
        </li>
      </ul>
