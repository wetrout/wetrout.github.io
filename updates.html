      <b style="font-size:24px">About This Page:</b><br>The purpose of this page is to show my progress as I learn more about
      building and formatting my website. I want to document each version I release along with information about changes I make.

  <section title="Version 1.0.0">
    <h3>6/22/19 - Version 1.0.0</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Updated:</b> This is the first version of my website. Project sites are not finsihed.
      In the month before school starts again, I expect to get a lot done and release
      at least a few more versions. Once my schedule gets more hectic, however,
      I will begin to release updates less frequently. My goal for version 1 of the
      site is to get it ready for the career fair in the fall so I can add a QR code
      link to my printed resume.

  <section title="Version 1.0.1">
    <h3>8/24/19 - Version 1.0.1</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Updated:</b> I changed a few things that others gave me feedback on.
      I also created first drafts for the project pages.
      I need to learn how to implement video into an html document and I will be able
      to finish these.
