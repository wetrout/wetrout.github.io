    <p><b style="font-size:24px">About This Page:</b><br>The purpose of this page is to show my progress as I learn more about
      building and formatting websites. I want to document each version I release
      along with information about changes I make.

    <h3>Version 1.0.0 Released 6/22/19</h3>
    <a href="homepage1.html" target="_blank"><img src="1.0.0screenshot.jpg" border="2px" style="border-color:black"></a>
    <p><b>Updated:</b> This is the first version of my website. Project sites are not finsihed.
      In the month before school starts again, I expect to get a lot done and release
      at least a few more versions. Once my schedule gets more hectic, however,
      I will begin to release updates less frequently. My goal for version 1 of the
      site is to get it ready for the career fair in the fall so I can add a QR code
      link to my printed resume.
