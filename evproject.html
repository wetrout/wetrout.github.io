  <h1>
    EV Charging Station Project
  </h1>
  <p>
    As part of the Heath IBEP Program at UT, I was placed on a team of business and engineering
    students and we worked together to assess the current and future demand of electric vehicles
    on campus. We then developed a scalable system that could be used to determine when and where
    to install new chargers. As an electrical engineer, I had a great opportunity to learn about 
    power systems and to speak with several professors and researchers to determine the logistical 
    possibility of this project.
