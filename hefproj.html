      Project 1: Calculations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our first project was an introduction to the different types of measurements/calculations
      we would be working with as engineering students. We had to compile and analyze
      survey data to draw conclusions.
    </p>
    <a href="157p1report.pdf" target="_blank">Project Report</a>
    <h4>
      What We Learned
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We learned how to estimate values with an appropriate balance of
        scientific accuracy and precision.
      </li>
      <li>
        We learned to develop a scientific report of our findings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project 2: Reverse-Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      We dissected a nonfunctioning coffee maker, studied its operation, and
      repaired it.
    </p>
    <h4>What We Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reverse-engineering and product research allowed us to identify every part of the
        coffee maker and its function.
      </li>
      <li>
        The coffee machine's circuit was broken and we learned how to use solder
        to fix it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project 3: Building a Model</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, we used a mousetrap to propel a car along a track.
    </p>
    <h4>What We Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Several times, we had great ideas fail and had to edit or completely scrap
        our progress to get the design working.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Project 1: Applying Concepts
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this project, we were tasked with building a barstool using only foam core
      and glue for its construction. We were also given specific parameters like a
      maximum height and width, and the stool had to have a cantilevered footrest.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What We Learned
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We were only given very limited materials for testing and design, so we
        learned to reduce testing and still deliver a successful design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Part of our grade was calculated based on how aesthetically pleasing our stool was,
        so we had to focus some of our efforts on visuals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Project 2: Starting from Scratch
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this project, we were not given a problem to solve. We had to do research
      to identify a problem in our area that pertained to the <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx" target="_blank">NAE Grand Challenges for Engineering</a>.
      We decided to design an after-school program that would help improve learning for Knoxville students.

    <h4>
      What We Learned
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We spent about 2/3 of the project focusing on need identification.
        It was a valuable experience to research and debate issues and the
        feasibility of different solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        This entire project was focused around teaching us the engineering design process
        and how to apply it beyond solving basic homework problems.
