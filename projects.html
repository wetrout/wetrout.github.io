      <a href="hefproj.html" target="_blank">EF 157/158 Projects</a>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        In these first-year engineering classes I was introduced to the
        engineering design process and completed several projects to learn
        how to apply these principles.

      <a href="ef230proj.html" target="_blank">Arduino-Controlled Manufacturing Arm</a>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        As part of a team, I added an Arduino Uno to an already-assembled
        robot arm and wrote a program in Matlab that picked up an object
        (from an assembly line), collected data about the object, and decided
        whether it should continue in an assembly line or be discarded.

      <a href="chengproj.html" target="_blank">Cycling Biometrics Research Project</a>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        I interviewed several cyclists and performed research to analyze the
        benefits of using biometric fitness-tracking technology while cycling.
      </dd>
    <dt>
      <a href="eagle.html" target="_blank">Eagle Scout Project</a>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        I built a greenhouse for a local Boys and Girls Club for my Eagle Scout
        project. I picked up many construction skills along the way.
      </dd>
    <dt>
      <a href="evproject.html" target="_blank">EV Charging Station Project</a>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        I helped my team of interdisciplinary students assess the University's
        electric vehicle charging capacity and develop a system to choose new spaces.
