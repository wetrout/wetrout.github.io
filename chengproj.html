      The Assignment
    </h3>
      <p>
        The intention of this class was to teach us to do human subjects
        research according to IRB standards for our Chancellor's Honors Program
        Senior research projects.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Paper 1
    </h3>
      <p>
        For my paper in this class, I chose to research biometric technology
        used by cyclists. I created a <a href="poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a>
        to present these findings to my class.<br>

    <h3>
      Paper 2
    </h3>
      <p>
        For the second <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mK4HyCoi4dhN8NBTzqghnd3rMAedxYttsjkipM0vL6A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">paper</a>
        in this class, I expanded on my research from Paper 1.
        I gathered more data and studied some of the potential drawbacks and hazards
        of using biometric fitness trackers.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What I Learned
    </h3>
      <p>
        We had to fill out a mock IRB proposal for our professor when we began
        working on the project. I learned how to perform ethical human subjects
        research and compile interview data into an accurate, concise sheet of
        usable quotes.<br>
        <br>
        I had just spent 2/3 of the semester studying this subject, but I was able to
        practice taking a new approach to an idea in research; as obvious as it
        might seem, I had not even considered researching the drawbacks of using
        biometrics.
